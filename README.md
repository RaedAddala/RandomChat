## 1.  **General Description:**

This project is a chatting platform that utilizes a random matching system to connect clients and manages their interactions, including the pairing of two clients and handling various events related to these functionalities. 

The architecture of the project is **Event-Driven**, which means that the logic is primarily handled by an Event Emitter (**Manager** class) responsible for sending messages, an Event Listener (**ConversationListener** class) responsible for receiving notifications and messages, and supporting classes such as **Logger** and **QueueManager** for server connection and client pairing.

The client program features a graphical user interface (GUI) consisting of two windows.

**Technologies Used: *Java RMI*, *Java Swing* and *Java Threads*.**


## 2. **How to Use It:**

This Project uses Java RMI technology so in order to use it first you have to:
1. **Have Java Installed and bin file added to the PATH Variable**
    ```
    # Test it using this
    java -version
    ```

1. **Start the RMI Registry:**
    ```
    # this should be done on its own terminal instance
    # In Windows:
    start rmiregistry
    # In Linux and Unix-based OS:
    rmiregistry &
    ```
1. **Run the Server:**
    ```
    # Go To binaries/Server folder and run this command:
    java ChatServer
    ```
1. **Run the Clients ( as many as you need to: )**
    ```
    # Go To binaries/Client folder and run this command:
    java ChatClient
    ```

## 3. **General Documentation:**
### **QueueManager :**

The QueueManager is a crucial component of the server **responsible for managing waiting queues and matching clients with each other**.

It runs on its own thread to handle concurrent operations efficiently.

The QueueManager effectively handles scenarios where a client exits a room or requests to be matched with another client. 

To ensure **a single instance is used throughout the server's lifecycle**, the QueueManager follows the **Singleton pattern**.

### **ITextReceiver : *INTERFACE* :**

The ITextReceiver interface establishes the requirements for classes responsible for **receiving messages**, **handling connections**, **matching** **and** **partner quitting notifications**.

### **ILogger: *INTERFACE* :**

Ensures that the class must handle **logging to the chat server.**

### **ITexter : *INTERFACE* :**

Ensures that the class must handle **entering** and **exiting a chat**, **sending messages** and **quitting the server.**

### **ChatServer:**

The ChatServer component includes a **graphical user interface** (**GUI**) that provides a visual representation of the current pairings using the **RoomTable** class.

It creates an **instance** of the **Logger** class to initiate the client matching process.

### **ChatClient [ GUI ]:**

The ChatClient is the client-side component that features a user-friendly GUI. 

The GUI consists of a **WelcomePanel**, responsible for initializing the listener and emitter, and a **ChatBox**, which displays sent and received messages.

### **ConversationListener ( ITextReceiver ) :**

The ConversationListener implements the ITextReceiver interface. 

It handles **notifications regarding entering or quitting the queue** and **receiving messages**. 

It contains an **instance** of **ITexter** responsible for sending messages and **a reference to the GUI instance** for displaying notifications and received messages.

### **Logger ( ILogger ):**
Ensures Connection between two clients.

Uses a **Manager** and receives an **ITextReceiver** instance reference as a listener which is then published within the manager and bound to the name registry.

### **Manager ( ITexter ):**

The Manager class is a critical component that implements the ITexter interface.

*Contains two classesâ€™ instances:*

- **ConversationManager**
- **QueueManager (**shared by all **Manager** instances**)**
- Uses the ConversationManager instance to send a message and handle its exceptions.
- Adds a client to chat queue and pair it with another client using the **QueueManager.**
- Handles quitting the chat/app event. 

### **RoomTable [ GUI ]:** 

The RoomTable component provides a GUI display on the server, showcasing all client connections and pairings in real-time.

###  **OnDisplayListener [ GUI-related Event Handler ]:**

The OnDisplayListener is responsible for handling window-related events in the GUI. 

It ensures a smooth quitting process without crashing the server or causing excessive blocking time for other clients.

Also, it ensures **joining** **a queue** first time the window is created.

###  **ConversationManager:**
 Responsible of handling all messaging operations within the chat platform.

Has **another ConversationManager instance reference** to match to and chat with.

The ConversationManager listens for incoming messages through an **ITextReceiver**.

Has a static variable **count,** used to generate unique IDs.
